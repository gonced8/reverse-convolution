# reverse-convolution
Notebook in Julia (Pluto.jl) showing how to reverse a convolution, such as a Gaussian Blur.

I wrote a Medium article explaining this problem and its implementation:
[Can you recover a blurred image? - Gon√ßalo Raposo - Medium](https://medium.com/@gonced8/can-you-recover-a-blurred-image-61bbcaa969d5?source=friends_link&sk=6ba12f33dc77906055e650f2ce2a8230)

If you want to see the code, open: [notebook](notebook.jl) or [pretty notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gonced8/reverse-convolution/blob/master/pretty_notebook.html)
